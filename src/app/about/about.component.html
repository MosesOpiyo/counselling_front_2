                <p>Afya-Bora counselling is a dedicated online-based team of consultant therapists, cognitive behavioral
                    therapists, practitioners and support staff that are collaboratively working to help people in need
                    of
                    emotional support. More so those with mental health disorder.
                    <br> This is not just a chat. It’s a complete toolbox. You get all the support and tools you need to
                    be
                    happier and to keep you emotionally stable. <br>

                    We know how difficult it can be to get a face-to-face therapy appointment these days. How expensive
                    it
                    can be. How impossible it can feel to squeeze in a visit in your already hectic schedule. How lonely
                    and
                    unsupported you can feel inbetween sessions. And how you just seem to forget all the things your
                    therapist told you since that last visit.
                    <br>
                    Therefore, there's no need to worry anymore as ABC is the solution for you at hand.
