                <p>Consultation is a dedicated online-based team of consultant therapists, cognitive behavioral therapists, practitioners and support staff that are collaboratively working to help people in need of emotional support. More so those with mental
                    health disorder.
                    <br> This is not just a chat. It’s a complete toolbox. You get all the support and tools you need to be happier and to keep you emotionally stable. <br> We know how difficult it can be to get a face-to-face therapy appointment these
                    days. How expensive it can be. How impossible it can feel to squeeze in a visit in your already hectic schedule. How lonely and unsupported you can feel inbetween sessions. And how you just seem to forget all the things your therapist
                    told you since that last visit.
                    <br> Therefore, there's no need to worry anymore as Consultation is the solution for you at hand.
